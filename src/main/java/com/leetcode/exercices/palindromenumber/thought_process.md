# Palindrome Number Solution Analysis

## Problem Understanding
The problem requires determining if a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, while 123 is not.

### Key Observations
1. Negative numbers cannot be palindromes because of the negative sign.
2. Numbers ending with 0 (except 0 itself) cannot be palindromes since they would require a leading zero.
3. Single-digit numbers are always palindromes.

## Solution Approach: Reversing Half of the Number

The solution uses an optimized approach that only reverses half of the number and compares it with the other half. This approach is more efficient than reversing the entire number.

### Algorithm Breakdown

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the number is negative, return `false` immediately.
   - If the number is not zero but ends with zero, return `false`.

2. **Reverse Half of the Number**:
   - Initialize a variable `reverse` to 0.
   - While the original number is greater than the reversed number:
     - Extract the last digit of the original number: `lastDigit = x % 10`.
     - Update the reversed number: `reverse = reverse * 10 + lastDigit`.
     - Remove the last digit from the original number: `x = x / 10`.

3. **Check for Palindrome**:
   - For even-length numbers: `x == reverse`.
   - For odd-length numbers: `x == reverse / 10` (to ignore the middle digit).

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1: x = 121**
- Initial: x = 121, reverse = 0
- After first iteration: x = 12, reverse = 1
- After second iteration: x = 1, reverse = 12
- Loop ends because x (1) is not greater than reverse (12)
- Check: x == reverse / 10 → 1 == 1 → `true`

**Example 2: x = 12321**
- Initial: x = 12321, reverse = 0
- After first iteration: x = 1232, reverse = 1
- After second iteration: x = 123, reverse = 12
- After third iteration: x = 12, reverse = 123
- Loop ends because x (12) is not greater than reverse (123)
- Check: x == reverse / 10 → 12 == 12 → `true`

**Example 3: x = 10**
- x % 10 == 0 and x != 0 → `false`

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(log₁₀n)
- The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the number, which is log₁₀n.
- For example, for a 3-digit number, we need at most 2 iterations.

### Space Complexity: O(1)
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (only a few variables).
- No additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.

## Why This Solution Is Optimal
1. **Efficiency**: Only reverses half of the number, reducing the number of operations by half compared to full reversal.
2. **Constant Space**: Uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.
3. **Early Termination**: Returns `false` immediately for negative numbers and numbers ending with zero (except zero itself).

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Negative Numbers**:
   - Input: -121
   - Output: `false` (due to the negative sign)

2. **Single Digit**:
   - Input: 5
   - Output: `true` (single digits are palindromes)

3. **Numbers Ending with Zero**:
   - Input: 10
   - Output: `false` (cannot have leading zeros)

4. **Even and Odd Length Numbers**:
   - Even: 1221 → `true`
   - Odd: 121 → `true`

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Convert to String**:
   - Convert the number to a string and check if it reads the same backward.
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(n) (due to string conversion)
   - Less efficient due to extra space and conversion overhead.

2. **Full Reversal**:
   - Reverse the entire number and compare with the original.
   - Time: O(log₁₀n), Space: O(1)
   - Works but does more work than necessary by reversing the entire number.

## Key Insight
The key insight is that you only need to reverse half of the number to determine if it's a palindrome. This optimization reduces both time and space complexity compared to full reversal or string conversion methods.

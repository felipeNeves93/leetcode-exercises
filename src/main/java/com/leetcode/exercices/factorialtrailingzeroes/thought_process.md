# Factorial Trailing Zeroes Solution Analysis

## Problem Understanding
The problem requires finding the number of trailing zeroes in n! (n factorial). A trailing zero is a zero at the end of a number that comes after any non-zero digit.

### Key Observations
1. Trailing zeroes are created by factors of 10 in the number.
2. Since 10 = 2 × 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n.
3. We need to count all multiples of 5, 25 (which contribute an extra 5), 125 (which contribute yet another 5), and so on.

## Solution Approach: Counting Factors of 5

The solution uses an efficient approach to count the number of times 5 appears in the factors of all numbers from 1 to n.

### Algorithm Breakdown

1. **Initialize a counter** to zero.
2. **Iterate through powers of 5**:
   - Start with 5^1 = 5
   - Continue with 5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125, etc.
3. **For each power of 5**:
   - Add the integer division of n by the current power of 5 to the counter
   - This counts how many multiples of that power exist up to n
4. **Return the counter** when the power of 5 exceeds n

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1: n = 5**
- 5! = 120
- Count multiples of 5: 5/5 = 1
- Total trailing zeroes: 1

**Example 2: n = 25**
- Count multiples of 5: 25/5 = 5
- Count multiples of 25: 25/25 = 1
- Total trailing zeroes: 5 + 1 = 6
- (25! actually has 6 trailing zeroes)

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(log₅n)
- The loop runs for each power of 5 less than or equal to n
- This is equivalent to the number of times you can divide n by 5 before it becomes less than 5
- For example, for n = 125, the loop runs 3 times (5, 25, 125)

### Space Complexity: O(1)
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space
- Only a few variables are used (count, currentPowerOfFive)

## Why This Solution Is Optimal
1. **Mathematical Insight**: Leverages the mathematical property that trailing zeroes are determined by the number of 5s in the prime factorization of n!
2. **Efficiency**: Avoids calculating the actual factorial, which would be infeasible for large n
3. **Logarithmic Time**: Achieves O(log₅n) time complexity, which is very efficient

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **n = 0**:
   - 0! = 1, which has 0 trailing zeroes
   - Correctly returns 0

2. **n < 5**:
   - Factorials of numbers less than 5 don't have any factors of 5
   - Correctly returns 0

3. **n is a multiple of 5**:
   - Correctly counts the additional factor from the exact power of 5

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Naive Approach**:
   - Calculate n! and count trailing zeroes
   - Problem: Causes overflow for n > 20 (with 32-bit integers)
   - Time: O(n) for multiplication, but impractical due to overflow

2. **Counting 5s in Prime Factorization**:
   - For each number from 1 to n, count its factors of 5
   - More straightforward but less efficient (O(n) time)
   - Still better than calculating the full factorial

## Key Insight
The key insight is recognizing that trailing zeroes come from factors of 10, and since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of n!. This is done efficiently by summing the integer divisions of n by increasing powers of 5.

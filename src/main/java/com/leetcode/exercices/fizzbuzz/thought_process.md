# FizzBuzz Solution Analysis

## Problem Understanding
The FizzBuzz problem requires generating a sequence of strings from 1 to n (inclusive) where:
- Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Fizz"
- Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Buzz"
- Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., 15) are replaced with "FizzBuzz"
- All other numbers are converted to strings as-is

## Solution Approach
The implemented solution follows these key steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with a counter at 1
   - Create an empty ArrayList to store results

2. **Iteration**:
   - Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive)
   - For each number, check divisibility conditions in this specific order:
     1. Check if divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., 15) first
     2. Then check if divisible by 3
     3. Then check if divisible by 5
     4. If none of the above, convert the number to a string

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Order of Conditions**: 
   - The most specific condition (divisible by both 3 and 5) is checked first
   - This prevents "Fizz" or "Buzz" from being added when "FizzBuzz" should be used
   - The order ensures correct output for numbers like 15, 30, etc.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution makes exactly n iterations (from 1 to n)
   - Each iteration performs a constant number of operations (modulo checks and list operations)
   - No unnecessary computations or complex data structures are used

## Performance Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm performs exactly n iterations
  - Each iteration does a constant amount of work (O(1))
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to n

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution creates a list that will contain exactly n elements
  - No additional space is used that grows with n
  - The output list itself is O(n) space, which is required by the problem

## Edge Cases Handled

- When n = 1: Returns ["1"]
- When n = 0: Returns an empty list (implicitly handled by the while loop condition)
- When n is at the upper constraint (10,000): Handles the maximum input size efficiently

## Alternative Approaches

1. **String Concatenation**:
   - Could build the string by checking divisibility by 3 and 5 separately
   - Might be less efficient due to string operations

2. **Hash Map Approach**:
   - Store mappings of divisors to their corresponding strings
   - More extensible for additional conditions but adds complexity
   - Slightly more overhead for this simple problem

The current solution provides the best balance of simplicity and efficiency for the given problem constraints.

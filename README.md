# LeetCode Exercises

Welcome to my LeetCode exercises repository! This is a collection of programming challenges I'm solving to improve my algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and Java programming abilities.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice and improve problem-solving skills
- Understand and implement various algorithms and data structures
- Document thought processes and solutions
- Track progress in algorithm and data structure mastery
- Prepare for technical interviews

## 📚 Exercises

### Easy
1. [Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/felipeNeves93/leetcode-exercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/leetcode/exercices/fizzbuzz) - Basic iteration and conditional logic
2. [Single Number](https://github.com/felipeNeves93/leetcode-exercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/leetcode/exercices/singlenumber) - Bit manipulation with XOR operation
3. [Palindrome Number](https://github.com/felipeNeves93/leetcode-exercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/leetcode/exercices/palindromenumber) - Number manipulation and comparison

### Medium
1. [Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://github.com/felipeNeves93/leetcode-exercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/leetcode/exercices/factorialtrailingzeroes) - Mathematical approach to count factors

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```
src/main/java/com/leetcode/exercices/
├── fizzbuzz/
│   ├── Solution.java      # Implementation
│   ├── description.md     # Problem description
│   └── thought_process.md # Solution explanation and analysis
```

## 📝 How to Use

1. Each exercise is organized in its own package
2. Every solution includes:
   - `Solution.java`: The implementation
   - `README.md`: Problem statement and examples
   - `thought_process.md`: Detailed explanation of the solution approach

## 🚀 Running the Code

1. Make sure you have Java JDK installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the specific problem directory
4. Compile and run the solution:
   ```bash
   javac Solution.java
   java Solution
   ```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

I'll be regularly updating this repository with new solutions and improvements. The goal is to maintain clean, well-documented code with explanations that can help others learn.
